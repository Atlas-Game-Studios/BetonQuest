# Installation

1. In order to use [BetonQuest](../../../Downloads/index.md) you (obviously)
   need to add the "_BetonQuest.jar_" to the "_plugins_" folder in the server. If you haven't downloaded it yet, you can
   get it from the [downloads page](../../../Downloads/index.md).

2. You also need [Citizens](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/13811/) for this
   tutorial. If you can't afford to buy it you can download it for free.
   Just give the first paragraph of their Spigot page a good read, and you will find the link to the free download.
   Also put the "_Citizens.jar_" file in your server's "_plugins_" folder.

3. You also need [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/1997/) for this
   tutorial. Put the "_ProtocolLib.jar_" file in your server's "_plugins_" folder as well.    
   You do have to be a bit careful with ProtocolLib. Often, the current release on Spigot may not support the latest version
   of Minecraft. You might have to download the latest dev build from their [dev build site](https://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/ProtocolLib/).

**Once you have installed these restart your server!**
