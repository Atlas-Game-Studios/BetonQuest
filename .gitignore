# IntelliJ
# JetBrains claims that everything except a few files should be added. However, users often have unique files that are generated by IntelliJ plugins.
# These may contain secrets or personal preferences. Instead we chose to track specific files with Git and ignore the rest.
# These are not documented using excludes in this file but were just added to the index via git add.
